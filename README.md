**Email Validator by Rafael Brito**
Welcome to the Email Validator repository, a custom variable template for Google Tag Manager (GTM). This tool, created for the community, allows for simple and efficient email address validation. Feel free to use and adapt it for your projects.

What It Does The Email Validator checks if a given text input is a valid email address, returning true or false.

This is ideal for: Validating forms to prevent triggering conversion events with invalid emails. Improving data quality sent to your marketing and analytics platforms. Reducing the complexity of custom validations within GTM.

**How to Use**
The easiest way to use the Email Validator is by installing it directly from the GTM Community Template Gallery. Open GTM: In your Google Tag Manager account, navigate to Templates > Variable Templates. Search for the template: Click "Search Gallery" and look for "Email Validator". Add to workspace: Select the template and click "Add to workspace". Create your variable: You can now create a new variable of the Email Validator type, specifying the value you want to validate (e.g., a form variable). Publish: Save and publish your changes to start using the validation in your tags and triggers.
